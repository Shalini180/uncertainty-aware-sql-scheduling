# 🌿 Carbon-Aware SQL Query Engine

A proof-of-concept query engine that reduces carbon emissions by choosing **when** and **how** to run SQL workloads based on real-time grid conditions.

Modern databases only optimize for speed.
But electricity gets cleaner or dirtier throughout the day.
If a workload isn’t urgent, delaying execution may significantly reduce its carbon footprint.

This project explores how **carbon awareness** can become a first-class concern in query planning.

✅ Key Capabilities

- Analyze SQL structure (joins, aggregations, complexity)

- Generate multiple execution plans: Fast / Balanced / Efficient

- Estimate runtime and approximate energy usage

- Retrieve real-time carbon-intensity data (or use fallback model)

- Select the best execution option based on:

- Query urgency

- Carbon intensity

- Performance trade-offs

- Optionally defer non-urgent queries to cleaner time windows

- Provide clear execution + decision explanation

Built on DuckDB for lightweight local execution

## 🧠 Why This Matters

> The carbon emissions of a query depend not only on how fast it runs,
> but also **when and where** it runs.

By scheduling non-urgent operations during low-carbon periods, large systems can reduce emissions at scale without changing the workload.

This repository demonstrates one possible design for a **sustainable database optimizer**.

### Core Components

| Component             | Role                                        |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Query Analyzer**    | Parses SQL + extracts query structure       |
| **Plan Compiler**     | Builds Fast / Balanced / Efficient variants |
| **Profiler**          | Estimates time + energy                     |

## 🔧 Requirements

* Python 3.10+
* DuckDB
* Linux / WSL2 recommended for energy measurements
* Optional: ElectricityMaps API token

> Without RAPL hardware, energy reporting is estimated.

## 📦 Installation

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd carbon-aware-sql-engine

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Optional `.env`:

```
ELECTRICITYMAPS_API_TOKEN=<token>
EM_ZONE=US-CAL-CISO
```

## ▶️ Quick Start

### Python

```python
from src.core.engine import CarbonAwareQueryEngine
from src.optimizer.selector import QueryUrgency

engine = CarbonAwareQueryEngine()

result, metrics, decision = engine.execute_query(
    "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM my_table",
    urgency=QueryUrgency.MEDIUM,
    explain=True
)

print(result)
print(metrics)
print(decision.explain())
```

### UI

```bash
streamlit run src/energy_ml/decision_app.py
```

---

## 📂 Directory Structure

```
src/
 ├─ core/          # Engine + profiling + execution
 ├─ optimizer/     # Policy + carbon integration
 └─ utils/         # SQL parsing
```

---

## ✅ Example Output

```
Plan chosen: Efficient
Reason: High grid carbon → minimize energy
Exec time: 412 ms
Energy: ~7 J
Emissions: ~0.004 g CO₂
Action: Deferred 90 min (non-urgent)
```

---

## ⚠ Limitations

* Most accurate on Linux / WSL2
* Scheduling is not persistent (PoC only)
* Carbon data depends on region/provider

---

## 🎯 Goal

Show that query planners can:

* Consider environmental signals
* Adjust execution strategy automatically
* Reduce emissions without developer involvement

> This is a research prototype, not a production database.
